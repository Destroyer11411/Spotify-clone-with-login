                Music/songs were initially stored in a big-sized magnetic discs run using gramophones later in the form
                of physical cassettes and CD’s. Later it was slowly moved to pen drives and then on to our phones within
                inbuilt memory. All these approaches were client bases, but the recent approach based on the cloud data
                is that we put music on cloud and enjoy features like on-demand streaming without even downloading the
                files.
